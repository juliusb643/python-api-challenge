Python API Challenge 
Module 6 Penn Data Science Challenge 

For this Module 6 Challenge, I was able to complete this by using Python and creating several charts, plots, and maps to describe relationships between several different global measurables. I completed this by using my past assignments in class, Xpert Learning Assistant, and ChatGPT. I collaborated with Kiet and Chau for smaller pieces that I was stuck on, and was able to complete the assignment! While there were mostly weak correlations between most of the categories and latitude, there were particularly strong correlations between temperature and latitude in both hemispheres. 

While I found this challenging, I'm quite proud of my ability to complete all tasks.
