Python API Challenge 
Module 6 Penn Data Science Challenge 

For this Module 6 Challenge, I was able to complete this by using Python and creating several charts, plots, and maps to describe relationships between several different global measurables. I completed this by using my past assignments in class, Xpert Learning Assistant, and ChatGPT. I collaborated with Kiet and Chau for smaller pieces that I was stuck on, and was able to complete the assignment! While there were mostly weak correlations between most of the categories and latitude, there were particularly strong correlations between temperature and latitude in both hemispheres. 

I have several images shown in the "output_data" folder, which is the results of my work for WeatherPy (section 1 of the homework)

This image is for VacationPy, which may not show up on GitHub. This is the map that showed Step 1, every city in the DataFrame and the size of the dots relate to Humidity

I'm also uploading this image, which shows my map for Step 5 of VacationPy.
